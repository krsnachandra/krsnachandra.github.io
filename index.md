I'm Chandra Musterer, a full-stack web developer with a passion for problem solving and creating quality products. I revel in fine-tuning projects to make them more secure, complete, and pleasing to the user even when things go wrong. When I'm not creating elegant code, you will find me creating elegant movements on the fusion dance floor.

In university I followed my interests and studied math and philosophy. During my time at York University my love of logic brought me to new heights. 

From customer service to sales and account management, I spent six successful years in payment processing. My project and business experience has made me sensitive to the needs of clients, managers, and coworkers. I believe that clear communication is essential to being a good teammate.

I am a conscientious employee, offering a fresh point of view. \
Being aware of the assumptions made will allow us to shake them up. \
Seeing the big picture will allow us to make better decisions. \
Hiring me will make your product better.
